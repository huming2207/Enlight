Built with Semantic-UI framework

Don't ask me why I didn't use any frameworks like Vue.js or Angular! It's difficult to squeeze those stuff together with UI libraries (730KB) into a 1MB data partition!

Besides, loading static contents via HTTP from ESP32 is extremely slow (~80 to 150KB/s) and the content should not be too huge.
